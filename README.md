MY CURRENT PROGRESS
================

Final Project: 

I have completed, to my best ability, the Final Project.


The extra credit challenges that I have successfully attempted and implemented are:

- Hidden file support for files beginning with a "."
- ls and ls -a
- FCFS scheduling



Thank you for a fun (and sometimes maddening) semester! I am looking forward to Theory of Programming Lang in the Spring.

Have a nice break.
