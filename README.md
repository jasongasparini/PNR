MY CURRENT PROGRESS
================

As of 10/9 all of my work for iP2 is pushed to the main branch.



2019 - 2021 Browser-based Operating System in TypeScript
========================================================

This is Alan's Operating Systems class initial project.
See https://www.labouseur.com/courses/os/ for details.
It was originally developed by Alan and then enhanced by alums Bob Nisco and Rebecca Murphy over the years.
Clone this into your own private repository. Better yet, download it as a ZIP file and use it to initialize your own repository for this class. 
Then add Alan (userid *Labouseur*) as a collaborator.
